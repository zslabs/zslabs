It's hard to believe it's been a year and a half since I first started playing around with GSAP. And unlike that new JavaScript framework that just came out yesterday (yes this statement applies no matter when you're reading this), I still find it to be an indispensable tool for building smooth and succinct user experiences.

I've given talks about it, built CSS/JS frameworks utilizing it, and helped tell brand stories with it. Rather than go through the ins-and-outs as you'd find in most any other blog post about it, here's a few good resources that I used when I was getting started and still use to this day.

* [GreenSock docs](https://greensock.com/docs/#/): The official go-to. Unlike some reference-guides, this provides detailed write-ups and clear examples.
* [I Hate Tomatoes](https://ihatetomatoes.net/greensock-cheat-sheet/): If you've been mulling around the GSAP community, then no-doubt have you come across the name Petr Tichy. He's got a real knack for putting things in layman terms. I've also found him to be incredibly insightful in tearing apart real world examples to find their inner-workings.
* [Chris Gannon](https://gannon.tv): Not only is Chris also great at stepping through his work on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/framespark), but his mastery of SVG filters is really something else. Don't let him tell you any different.
* [CodePen](http://codepen.io/search/pens?q=GSAP&limit=all&type=type-pens): The perfect place to take something cool, fork it, and make it your own. A great way to journey into breaking things and fixing them again. In-fact, if you ask for support on GSAP's forums, they'll ask you to create a CodePen so they can see things in action.

I thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight some of the cool experiments I've had the opportunity of working on that included GSAP.
