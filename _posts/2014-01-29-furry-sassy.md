While fads come and go, one that I personally have stuck with since it's inception is [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) by [Zurb](http://zurb.com). Foundation is a front-end CSS/JS framework that makes it crazy easy to prototype and develop sites/apps. It's amazing to look back at what Foundation once was and what it has become - and for me, it's an integral part of my day to day workflow.

Foundation has not only helped me developer faster, but smarter. [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), the CSS pre-processor behind Foundation has guided me in creating more structured base setups; taking advantage of the plethora of amazing features it offers, like [mixins](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins), [@extend](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend) (ZOMG) and [variables](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_).

There's tons of ways to get started using SASS. If you're on a Mac (which everyone should be nowadays), [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) gives you all the benefits of compilation, concatination and minification &mdash; without the need for installing system tools. Windows users can even join the fun with [Scout](http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/). And for all the terminal junkies out there like me, [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com) fits the bill quite nicely.

One thing to keep in mind when using frameworks like Foundation or [Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is that these are simply toolkits - not turnkey solutions. Just because you can, doesn't mean you always should - so be original while using these frameworks. In-fact, I probably use about 15-25% of Foundation, but it's those reusable parts that have made development that much more enjoyable.
